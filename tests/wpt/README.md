# Web Platform Tests (WPT) — Lumen integration

P2-wpt (`docs/tasks/p2-wpt-integration.md`, slices S1–S8). Runs the real, unmodified
`wptrunner` against Lumen over WebDriver BiDi (`lumen --bidi-port N`) — not a
bespoke test runner. See the task doc for the full architecture and slice plan.

**Status:** S1 (real `browsingContext.load` signal) and S2 (vendoring, this file)
are done. `wpt run lumen …` does not work yet — that's S3 (`browsers/lumen.py`
product plugin) and S4 (first smoke test). This README covers what S2 delivers:
the vendored, offline-capable `wptrunner` + a Python environment that can import it.

## What's here

- `tools/wptrunner/`, `tools/manifest/`, `tools/serve/`, `tools/wptserve/`,
  `tools/webdriver/`, `tools/metadata/`, `tools/gitignore/`, `tools/localpaths.py`
  (repo root, alongside `crates/`) — vendored upstream WPT tooling, unmodified.
  Pin + rationale: `tests/wpt/VENDOR.md`.
- `tests/wpt/resources/testharness.js` — vendored upstream client-side test harness.
- `tests/wpt/dom/nodes/` — one vendored test category (S4's smoke-test candidate,
  `Document-createElement.html`, lives here).
- `tests/wpt/requirements.txt` — pip requirements to make the above importable.

## Python setup

Requires Python 3.9+ (verified against 3.14). From the repo root:

```bash
python -m venv .venv-wpt          # any venv location outside the repo's gitignored area works
.venv-wpt/Scripts/python -m pip install -r tests/wpt/requirements.txt   # Windows
# .venv-wpt/bin/python -m pip install -r tests/wpt/requirements.txt    # Linux/macOS
```

This is tooling setup only — not a Cargo dependency, no `docs/plan/tech-stack.md`
entry needed (see that file's dependency-policy scope: Rust deps only).

### Verifying the install (import-chain smoke check)

Confirms the vendored tree + pip deps actually resolve, without yet running a test
(that's S3/S4 — no `browsers/lumen.py` product plugin exists yet, so `wpt run lumen`
isn't a command yet):

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import sys, os
root = os.path.abspath(".")
here = os.path.join(root, "tools")
sys.path[:0] = [root, here, os.path.join(here, "wptserve"),
                os.path.join(here, "webdriver"), os.path.join(here, "wptrunner")]

import localpaths                       # noqa: F401  (repo_root bootstrap)
import manifest.manifest                # noqa: F401  (test manifest)
from tools.serve import serve           # noqa: F401  (local HTTP/WS test server)
import wptrunner.wptrunner              # noqa: F401  (the runner)
import wptrunner.wptcommandline         # noqa: F401  (CLI arg parsing)
from webdriver.bidi.client import BidiSession  # noqa: F401  (S3 will drive this)
print("wptrunner import chain OK")
PY
```

Expected output: `wptrunner import chain OK`. This is exactly the import closure
`tools/wptrunner`'s own module-load time touches (`environment.py` →
`tools.serve.serve`, `testloader.py`/`metadata.py` → `manifest.manifest`) — if any
of it breaks after a re-vendor or a dependency bump, this is where it'll show up
first, before anything BiDi-specific.

## Fully offline

Once `pip install -r tests/wpt/requirements.txt` has populated the venv, nothing
above touches the network — the vendored tree in `tools/`/`tests/wpt/` is a
committed snapshot (`tests/wpt/VENDOR.md`), not a submodule or a runtime clone.

## Adding a test / growing the suite

Not yet applicable — S5 ("Expectations + curated subset") is where the included
test set grows past the single vendored `dom/nodes/` category and `.ini`
expectations get introduced. This section will be filled in then.

## Re-vendoring

See the "Re-vendoring" section of `tests/wpt/VENDOR.md`.
